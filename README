NAME
    `Device::BusPirate' - interact with a Bus Pirate device

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows a program to interact with a Bus Pirate hardware
    electronics debugging device, attached over a USB-emulated serial port.
    In the following description, the reader is assumed to be generally
    aware of the device and its capabilities. For more information about the
    Bus Pirate see:

      http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate

    This module and its various component modules are based on Future,
    allowing either synchronous or asynchronous communication with the
    attached hardware device. For simple synchronous situations, the class
    may be used on its own, and any method that returns a `Future' instance
    should immediately call the `get' method on that instance to wait for
    and obtain the eventual result.

     my $spi = $pirate->enter_mode( "SPI" )->get;

CONSTRUCTOR
  $pirate = Device::BusPirate->new( %args )
    Returns a new `Device::BusPirate' instance to communicate with the given
    device. Takes the following named arguments:

    serial => STRING
        Path to the serial port device node the Bus Pirate is attached to.
        If not supplied, a default of /dev/ttyUSB0 will be used.

    baud => INT
        Serial baud rate to communicate at. Normally it should not be
        necessary to change this from its default of `115200'.

METHODS
    The following methods documented with a trailing call to `->get' return
    Future instances.

  $mode = $pirate->enter_mode( $modename )->get
    Switches the attached device into the given mode, and returns an object
    to represent that hardware mode to interact with. This will be an
    instance of a class depending on the given mode name.

    `BB'
        The bit-banging mode. Returns an instance of
        Device::BusPirate::Mode::BB.

    `SPI'
        The SPI mode. Returns an instance of Device::BusPirate::Mode::SPI.

    Once a mode object has been created, most of the interaction with the
    device would be done using that mode object, as it will have methods
    relating to the specifics of that hardware mode. See the classes listed
    above for more information.

  $pirate->start->get
    Starts binary IO mode on the Bus Pirate device, enabling the module to
    actually communicate with it. Normally it is not necessary to call this
    method explicitly as it will be done by the setup code of the mode
    object.

  $pirate->stop
    Stops binary IO mode on the Bus Pirate device and returns it to user
    terminal mode. It may be polite to perform this at the end of a program
    to return it to a mode that a user can interact with normally on a
    terminal.

TODO
    *   More modes - I2C, UART, 1-wire, raw-wire

    *   Concept of "chips" - models of attached devices and defined ways to
        interact with them. Maybe "chip" isn't the best name for e.g. MIDI
        over UART or PS/2.

    *   PWM, AUX frequency measurement and ADC support.
